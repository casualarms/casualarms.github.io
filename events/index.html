		<h2>Community Events</h2>
		
		<p>The Casual ARMS events are for all players to join in! Information on all our events are always found on the Casual ARMS <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord server</em></a>. We run all games in their friend lobby mode, so you just need to add one of the lobby hosts as a <em class="switch-bg">Switch</em> friend to participate.</p>

		<h2>Our Event Hosting Team</h2>
		
		<p>Members of our <em>event hosting team</em> can volunteer to host a timeslot featuring the custom game modes of their choice, even if it's not one of our primary features!</p>
		
		<p>All of our <em>event hosts</em> are volunteers that contribute their own time so that we can keep a wide variety of events and games available for our community to play! If you would like to get involved so that you can help with hosting our exisiting events or create new opportunities for people to play, contact <em>Rashiko</em> on our <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord</em></a> server.</p>
